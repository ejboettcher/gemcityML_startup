## GemCity ML: A walk through JuypterAI

Last year I gave a talk on how to use Tensorflow to predict when we will have another sunspot,from a tutorial from DeepLearning AI:
 
[Deeplearning-AI worksheet on fitting Sun Spot data with timeseries](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-1-public/blob/main/C4/W4/ungraded_labs/C4_W4_Lab_3_Sunspots_CNN_RNN_DNN.ipynb)


| Raw data | Prediction |

### This go around

Going to use Juypter AI with OpenAI's ChatGPT to find all of the peaks and then get the mean spacing of the peaks.

Then we are going to compare it with how a data scientist would do with with scipy.
