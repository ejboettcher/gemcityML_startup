### So, my FOMO kicked in

## What does it take to start a business

* People: Don't start a business by yourself.  Very hard (see Evelyn Boettcher)
* Money
* Ideal
* Ability to fail
* [Organization](data/worksheets.pdf)

<br>
  
### Why ability to fail

* If you are living pay check to pay check, you can't afford to fail.
* If you need medical insurance, you can't afford to fail.
* If you are getting ready to retire, you can't afford to fail.

<br>

Basically, are you young and healthy.

---

## Money

You need at least 3 months of funding for yourself.
If you plan to bring people in, 3 months of payroll. 
<br>

Even if you start selling right away, you have to pay people timely and it can take months (60-90 days) before your first customer will pay their invoice.

## Ideal

* What can make money
* What will imspire people to fund you
* What do you want to pitch


<br>
<br>

### Let's Brainstorm ideas

#### Goal

Find an ideal we like tonight.  
Then in September, focus on building a min viable product or build out a vision board and pitch.

## Brainstorm Example

### Agile AI scrum bot
#### Why: 

Humans are poor at keeping track of more than 3 items and on the fly calculate risks.
There are many poor Managers that seem to either follow a recipe or don't know how busy, hours left you have, or give creepy vibes.

* Scrum bot will use the well-structured agile method to manage sprint teams.
* Scrum bot will keep track and predict when employees are at risk of losing funding.
* Real time tracking of tickets.  
* Balances workloads.  Knows how quickly a 2d task really takes for employee A and B, by usings statistics.
* Stays on topic.

### Manage AI

Great bosses are rare.  Let the poor one be replaced.
